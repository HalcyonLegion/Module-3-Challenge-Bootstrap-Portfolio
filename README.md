# Module-3-Challenge-Bootstrap-Portfolio

# Creating a Boostrap Portfolio Challenge

## Description

I was tasked with recreating the portfolio from the Module 2 Challenge in Bootstrap, which is far more attractive and a better vehicle to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill full or part-time positons. My portfolio will eventually showcase my strongest work and my though processes behind it. This time I have elected to showcase some of the very minor projects I have done myself as opposed to use the stock ones provided.

I keep in mind that students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after this boot camp. Having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

The main section contains the About Me, My Skills, My Work and Contact Me areas all of which are linked up. I have included some of my own work this time as well as the Module 1 Challenge. All of these are linked to live pages on my GitHub.
